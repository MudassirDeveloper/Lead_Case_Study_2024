Business Objective:
The goal is to assist X Education in identifying the most promising leads (hot leads), which are the ones most likely to convert into paying customers. The focus includes:
a) Identifying hot leads
b) Targeted marketing strategies
c) Improving the lead conversion rate

Goals of the Case Study:
Develop a logistic regression model that assigns a score between 0 and 100 to each lead, allowing the business to prioritize potential leads. A higher score would indicate a hot lead with a high likelihood of conversion, while a lower score would suggest a cold lead, less likely to convert.
